# Change Log

## 4.0 ‚Äî Initial public version of Princeton Geniza Project v4

-   public site
    -   As researcher, I want footnotes from the same source counted and displayed as a single scholarship record so that multiple links to parts of same document don't inflate the scholarship count and display.
    -   As a frontend user, I want all tags to be clickable so I can easily view all documents with those tags.
    -   As a front end user, I need to be able to see when more than 5 tags exist for search results because it's confusing to search for a tag and not see it displayed.

    -   As a content admin, I want to easily see and sort documents that need review so that I can manage the queue more efficiently.
