<h2>History</h2>
<p>The PGP consists of four interlinked types of data:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Metadata records (including shelfmarks and descriptions)</li>
    <li>Digitized, searchable transcriptions of geniza texts</li>
    <li>
        Scans of index cards, transcriptions and translations from Goitein’s
        unpublished research materials, as well as some scans of published
        translations
    </li>
    <li>Images of fragments, or links to images.</li>
</ul>

    Keeping the metadata accurate and well-structured is a labor-intensive team
    effort. Our team-members also produce new descriptions and transcriptions of
    material, as do Princeton undergraduates and graduate students in classes
    with Eve Krakowski and Marina Rustow.

    In 2020, at the behest of the
    <a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/">Center for Digital Humanities</a>, the
    PGL started deploying project managers to track the moving parts of the
    enterprise. The PMs have been transformative not just for organizing our
    work, but also for creating a sense of camaraderie.

    The team communicates via Slack and tracks tasks in Asana. Some of the team
    members meet at least twice weekly. The full team meets once per semester.
    We have icebreaker questions, which are good tools keeping the fun quotient
    high.

    The current browser was developed and is managed by Ben Johnston,
    Educational Technology Consultant in Princeton’s McGraw Center for Teaching
    and Learning, who has been the technical brain behind the PGP for over a
    decade. The transcriptions are lightly encoded in TEI. We manage the texts
    and the website in Drupal.

    The metadata is stored in the backend in Google Sheets and pushed out to the
    PGP site every 24 hours. The transcriptions are stored in Bitbucket.

    Previous versions of the PGP database were based on the TextGarden web
    application developed in 2005 by Rafael Alvarado, Manager of Humanities
    Computing Research Applications at Princeton, and the original browser
    developed by Peter Batke at Princeton in the late 1990s.
